# Nutrient Analysis - Team 76 - 11785 S22 Project

This is the code repository of Team 76's project on Nutrient Analysis, for the S22 course 11785 - Introduction to Deep Learning at CMU.

## Structure

- results: evaluation of models' performance.
- sample_data: some sample data used for training and testing.
- src: The notebook file that contains implementation of the dataset, the models, the multi-task loss function, and evaluation. Each cell has an associated text element in markdown so everything should be fairly self-explanatory.
- deprecated: old code and results that are saved for reference.
